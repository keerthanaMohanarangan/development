* Selecting via [], which slices the rows.

* Operations with objects that have different dimensionality and need alignment. In addition, pandas automatically broadcasts along the specified dimension.
* You can apply functions to the data
* pandas provides various facilities for easily combining together Series, DataFrame, and Panel objects with various kinds of set logic for the indexes and relational algebra functionality in the case of join / merge-type operations.
* SQL style merges style are also posible joining section.
* Append rows to a dataframe.
