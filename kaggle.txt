                                           Kaggle Kernal


Kaggle Kernels is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis.
Kernels supports scripts in R and Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports.
Analysing the each variable and analysing the importance for the problem, relation between dependent variable and independent variables.

Kernel runs using Docker containers. For every user, it mounts the input to the container with docker images preloaded with the most common data science languages and libraries. 
It can be considered a script/notebook with environment/data already setup. Advantages are as follows,
Docker containerization allows easy setup of kaggle projects.
No requirement to download data due to usage of same common volume mounted into the container.
Allows, user to share and learn from different approaches.
Kaggle kernels are good for the above reasons which improves life of a data scientist.
